# AAE-439-Trajectory-Code
## How to Use
Download all .m files and place in the same folder. Add that folder to
MATLAB's path and run 'AAE439_Trajectroy_Code.m'. The program will ask for 
a couple of inputs which will be determined on the launch day. Press run to
run the code, the program will tehn return to the user what launch angle 
should be used to have the rocket return to it's original location.

## Upcoming Changes
This code accounts for drag, lift, variable atmospheric density, and 
variable gravity. The drag and lift data that this code uses is not based
on any experimental data and need to be updated accordingly. Additionally, 
we plan on adding considerations for moments induced by the geometry of the
rocket.
